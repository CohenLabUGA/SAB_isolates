# Iron physiology and metabolism of model phytoplankton taxa in the South Atlantic Bight

## Project Background

This project paired physiology and transcriptomics to study the impact of iron availablility on phytoplankton isolates from the South Atlantic Bight (SAB). The SAB is a wide continental shelf ecosystem in the south east US that hosts diverse, productive phytoplankton communities. Iron availability decreases with distance from the shore, and physiochemical properties seperates the SAB into distinct shelf zones. The outer shelf is flanked by the Gulf Stream which regularly introduces nutrient rich North Atlantic Deep Water to the photic zone with latitudinal fluctuations in its position. These intrusions stimulate phytoplankton blooms that can grow into iron limitation because the retention time of SAB shelf water is ~9-11 weeks. 

A <i>C. closterium</i> and coccolithophores (<i>G. oceanica</i> and <i>G. huxleyi</i>) were isolated from the inner and outer shelf zone, respectively. Isolates were grown in steady state high and low iron treatments, with an addition 24 hr iron amendment treatment with half of the low iron treatment volume. The cultures were harvested at early exponention growth, after which physiological parameters were measured and RNA was extracted.
